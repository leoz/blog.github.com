Try WEB 2.0 editor!

  
  
Why?  
  


  1. It's cool!  
  2. It's free.  
  3. It's possible to post to your own blog from it.

  
Get it here: [Writely](http://www.writely.com)

This blog post was made from Writely and later corrected with MS Windows Live Writer.

P.S. I will not recommend it for everyday use. It has lots of problems and it's still beta quality.
