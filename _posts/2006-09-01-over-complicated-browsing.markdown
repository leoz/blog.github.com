There is one Firefox extension that can convert it into a "semantic web browser": [Piggy Bank](http://simile.mit.edu/piggy-bank/).

It's about 5.5 MB and also requires Java. It provides another "view" to a web page by gathering some statistics and reformatting the page layout accordingly.

Didn't quite get what is a purpose of all this "enhancements" but, nevertheless, I'm sure it's a trend.
