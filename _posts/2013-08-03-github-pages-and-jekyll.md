I migrated my blog to GitHub Pages and Jekyll from WordPress and PHP.
Jekyll is a static site building system. GitHub supports it by default.
I took Jekyll-Bootstrap as a starting point, migrated all of my old WordPress blog entries and made some final touch with CSS and JavaScript.
Jekyll on GitHub Pages does not support plug-ins due to security reasons. So there is no way to use all that fancy stuff made with Ruby.
But there are plenty of other ways to enhance the blog with e.g. jQuery and CSS.
