I have been using this release for at least couple of weeks.
It is much more stable and has many big fixes for annoying bugs from the previous release.  See more about improvements [here](http://browser.garage.maemo.org/news/4/).

The second public release has also support for Google Spreadsheets.

This is how it was in the 1st release:

Now it looks much better:
