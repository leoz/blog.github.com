I published some packages on NPM which could be useful for somebody working with XML-RPC API:

1. [SAX Parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sax-parser) - an XML parser written in JavaScript
2. [UTF-8 and Base64](https://www.npmjs.com/package/utf8-base64) - UTF-8, Base64 and Base64url Javascript encoding
3. [XML-RPC parser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/xmlrpc-parser) - XML-RPC to JSON parser and converter

These are pure JavaScript libraries which should work with e.g. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) or [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/).
