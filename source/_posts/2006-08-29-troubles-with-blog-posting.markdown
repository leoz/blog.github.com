It is not actually a trivial thing to make a blog post. I've spend about 25 minutes trying to write all the stuff about WordPress, spell checker in Firefox 2.0 Beta and so on. And what is a result? Firefox crashed and destroyed all my data with nice looking lists, links and a custom HTML editing. I gave up. I went for [Windows Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/) and now I'm more or less happy with this tool.
