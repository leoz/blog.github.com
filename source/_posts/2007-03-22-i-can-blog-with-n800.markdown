I own one of the Nokia N800 Internet Tablet devices. Now it seems to be possible to blog right from the device.

I'm using Maemo Blog application for it. The program is still beta-alike. It is very limited and doesn't store categories.

Here is my current N800 desktop:

<p>
<a class="fancybox" href="/uploads/2007/03/n800-screenshot-01.png" title="Nokia N800">
	<img src="/uploads/2007/03/n800-screenshot-01.png" alt="Nokia N800" height="195" width="320">
</a>
</p>

I've created this post with Maemo Blog.
Mostly ;-)
