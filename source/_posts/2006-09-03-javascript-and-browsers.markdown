One guy made JavaScript speed comparison between Firefox, IE and Opera: [JavaScript Speed Tests](http://celtickane.com/projects/jsspeed.php).

Results are such: **Firefox, IE - suxx, Opera - rulez**.

There is another comparison regarding standards support: [Link #1](http://www.webdevout.net/browser_support.php), [Link #2](http://www.webdevout.net/browser_support_summary.php) and [Link #3](http://www.webdevout.net/browser_support_summary.php?uas=IE6-IE7-FX1_5-OP8-OP9).

Nevertheless, when it comes to AJAX support the result could be opposite. Check [Netvibes](http://www.netvibes.com/) with the browser of Your choice.
